          <h4><b>Objectives</b></h4>
          <p>
            As cities continue to grow and the number of cars on the roads increases, urban mobility becomes an increasingly important issue (Gonzalo-Orden et al., 2014). Congestion and air pollution through increased greenhouse gas emissions are some challenges posed by this growth in traffic (Tektelic, 2022). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has made cycling more popular, as many people see it as a safer and more socially distanced mode of transportation (Büchel et al., 2022). Active, sustainable transportation, such as cycling, can be an effective solution to these challenges while also promoting physical activity and healthy living (Mueller et al., 2015).
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, to tackle this issue of sustainable mobility and build upon existing cycling maps, we have developed the web application <i>GTAccess to Cycling</i>. As implied by its name, the focus of the app is the GTA, which is divided into five regions: Toronto, Durham, Halton, Peel, and York regions. <i>GTAccess to Cycling</i> provides a wide range of GTA cycling-related information and resources in one location, from introductory urban bikeway distinctions to advanced planning tools, hence catering to a diverse audience of current and prospective cyclists. The app combines details present in otherwise independent sources into a fully interactive setting, highlighting existing bike shops and bike parking facilities, presenting and distinguishing amongst the most common bikeway types, and showcasing bike share stations with their live number of available bikes and docks. Further, it fills the gap that existing cycling maps have in condition information by incorporating real-time weather and traffic data, hence creating a more thorough resource for cyclists. Overall, <i>GTAccess to Cycling</i> aims to both encourage more people to embrace cycling as a mode of transportation in the GTA, and to promote safety and well-being while cycling in urban environments.
